# Teleportation 🎮

## 📜 Overview
**Teleportation** is a simple **2D retro-style game** built in **Turbo C++** using the classic `graphics.h` library.  
You control a player (a circle) in a bordered arena, moving through **portals** that instantly teleport you to other locations.  

The game is made for a **DOS-based Turbo C++ environment** and is a fun throwback to early graphics programming.
